# Contributing to Hangoutsbot

:+1::tada: Firstly, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Here are some guidelines to help you get started. If you can follow these suggestions then it will make your contribution easier for us to review and, hopefully, accept. It will also save you time when contributing.

* Please make your pull request to *staging* rather than *master*
* If you are creating a new plugin or modifying a plugin, you MUST update the wiki documentation of that plugin before making the pull request
